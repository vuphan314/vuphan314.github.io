  title={{Weighted Model Counting with Algebraic Decision Diagrams}},
  abstract={
    We present an algorithm to compute exact literal-weighted model counts of Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form. Our algorithm employs dynamic programming and uses algebraic decision diagrams as the primary data structure. We implement this technique in ADDMC, a new model counter. We empirically evaluate various heuristics that can be used with ADDMC. We then compare ADDMC to state-of-the-art exact weighted model counters (Cachet, c2d, d4, and miniC2D) on 1914 standard model counting benchmarks and show that ADDMC significantly improves the virtual best solver.
